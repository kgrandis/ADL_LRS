*Enabling S3 Support*

This document covers the steps needed to enable support for S3 or S3-compatible
cloud storage service.

**Amazon S3 Setup**

***Create a User***

Create an user for use with the LRS's interaction with S3 via IAM. Be
sure to set and restrict permissions.

Request and note the access and secret keys for this user.

***S3 Bucket***

Create a bucket for use by the LRS. Note its name and region.

You will also need to create a few folders within this bucket

 * agent_profile
 * activity_profile
 * activity_state
 * attachment_payloads


**Project Setup**


***settings.ini***

Several additional settings values need to be set for S3 support.

Add this section to your default `settings.ini` and replace the values
with your account's information.

```
[s3]
USE_S3: True
AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME: <bucket_name>
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: <AWS access key>
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: <AWS secret key>
AWS_LOCATION: <AWS region>

```

***Setup the environment***

Instead of running `fab setup_env` run *`fab setup_env:s3`* . This will
ensure the environment pulls in the necessary dependencies for proper S3
usage.


***Setup the LRS***

Instead of running `fab setup_lrs` run *`fab setup_lrs:s3`* . This will
bootstrap the LRS with S3 in mind. For instance, the media subdirectory
folders will not be created in the local directory structure.
